# Data-Analytics-Case-Study
A Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics course.

In this case study, I act as a data analyst for Cyclistic a fictional Bike-Sharing company in Chicago. I prepared, processed, and analyzed data for Cyclistic. I then created data visualizations and presented data insights to help Cyclistic improve their strategies.
